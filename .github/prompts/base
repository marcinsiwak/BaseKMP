- Follow instructions, add only what asked for and what is necessary to complete project
- Never add any migrations, only add code to the files
- Analyze build.gradle files in modules where changes were made and add necessary dependencies
- After all steps sync (if necessary), build the project (use gradle build task) and offer to fix errors if any
