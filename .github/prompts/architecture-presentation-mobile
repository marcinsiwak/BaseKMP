# Mobile Presentation Architecture Example (MVI Pattern)
- Follow the implementation of ui-example and usage of it's ViewModel, Screen, ViewState, UiAction, and NavigationGraph.
- Create:
    - ViewModel - ExampleViewModel
    - Screen - ExampleScreen
    - ViewState - ExampleViewState (if needed)
    - UiAction - ExampleUiAction (if needed)
    - build.gradle - add necessary dependencies which are already used in project
    - NavigationGraph - ExampleNavGraph - put in graph package
- Update:
    - shared-frontend/navigation/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/msiwak/destination/NavDestination.kt - ExampleDestination should be created under NavDestination sealed class in navigation module
    - composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/pl/msiwak/navigation/NavigationGraphs.kt with new NavigationGraph
